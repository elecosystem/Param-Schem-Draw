# ParamSchemDraw
**Parametrized Schematic Draw**

A set of classes and methods to ease the of use of [SchewDraw](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/SchemDraw) for parametrized circuit schematic's drawing and to simplify the creation and resolution of parametrized circuit analysis exercises using [MEGUA](https://github.com/jpedroan/megua).


## Contents
- Classes to suport multiple eletrical components, such as:
	- Resistors
	- Capacitors
	- Inductors
	- Voltage Sources
	- Current Sources

- Multiple tools to help the use and manipulation of this components
	- Engineering Formatting
	- Parallel and Series association
	- Impedance, Admittance, Reactance, Susceptance
	- Voltage and Current Dividers

- Two port network
	- Impedance
	- Admittance
	- Hibrid parameters
	- Inverse Hibrid parameters
	- A Parameters (also known as Transmission Parameters)
	- B parameters (also known as A', A inverser parameters or Scattering Parameters)


## History
This tool started to cover the needs of a Electronic Learning Ecosystem, being developed by a group of students at [Aveiro University](https://www.ua.pt/). 
This project was later integrated in [SIACUA](http://siacua.web.ua.pt/). SIACUA is an autonomous learning ecosystem being developed by a group of teachers (and now students) at [Aveiro University](https://www.ua.pt/), providing video-classes, exercises and theorical content.
