# ParamSchemDraw
## Parametrized Schematic Draw

***

#### A set of classes and methods to ease the of use of [SchewDraw](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/SchemDraw) for parametrized circuit schematic's drawing and to simplify the creation and resolution of parametrized circuit analysis exercises using [MEGUA](https://github.com/jpedroan/megua).


Offers:
 * Classes to suport multiple eletrical components, such as:
   * Resistors
   * Capacitors
   * Inductors
   * Voltage Sources
   * Current Sources

 * Multiple tools to help the use and manipulation of this components
   * Engineering Formatting
   * Parallel and Series association
   * Impedance, Admittance, Reactance, Susceptance
   * Voltage and Current Dividers

 * Two port network
   * Impedance
   * Admittance
   * Hibrid parameters
   * Inverse Hibrid parameters
   * A Parameters (also known as Transmission Parameters)
   * B parameters (also known as A', A inverser parameters or Scattering Parameters)

It started to cover the needs of a Electronic Learning Ecosystem a group of students intend to create at [Aveiro University](https://www.ua.pt/). It ended up being inserted in a larger project, called [SIACUA](http://siacua.web.ua.pt/), here a group of teachers (and now students) at [Aveiro University](https://www.ua.pt/) intend to create an autonomous learning ecosystem with video-classes, exercises and theorical content.
